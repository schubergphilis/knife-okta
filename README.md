# knife-okta

knife-okta is a knife plugin to interact with the Okta API.

The initial use case is to create data bags based on Okta group membership.

## Installation

As with all knife plugins, just install the gem:

```
gem install knife-okta
```

Or if you use ChefDK:

```
chef gem install knife-okta
```

## Usage

This plugin works the same as the `knife data bag from file` sub command, but instead queries Okta for a group's active members:

```
knife data bag from okta group BAG ITEM GROUP [GROUP..] (options)
```

The following parameters are added with this sub command:

```
        --max-change MAX_CHANGE             Set the maximum amount of allowed changes
    -a, --okta-attribute OKTA_ATTRIBUTE     Specify the user profile attribute to return
    -o, --okta-endpoint  OKTA_ENDPOINT      Set the Okta API endpoint (e.g. https://yourorg.okta.com/api/v1)
    -t, --okta-token OKTA_TOKEN             Set the Okta API token
        --show-changes                      Show any changes when uploading a data bag item
        --show-members                      Show data bag item members when uploading a data bag item

```

You can also add Okta options to your knife config file:

```
knife[:okta_attribute] = 'login'
knife[:okta_endpoint]  = 'https://myorg.okta-emea.com/api/v1'
knife[:okta_token]     = '004zNgntseobUzztBLSraij...'
```

## Examples

These examples assume the Okta configuration has been set in your knife config file.

### Create a data bag item from a single Okta group

To create a data bag called `users` with a data bag item called `linux_admins` that contains the display names of the group members:

```
knife data bag from okta group users linux_admins Linux-Admins -a displayName
```

* The `-a` option determines which profile attribute to populate the data bag with, at this time only `displayName`, `email` and `login` are supported.

### Create a data bag item from multiple Okta groups

You can specify multiple groups by providing a comma separated value:

```
knife data bag from okta group users admins Linux-Admins,Windows-Admins -a displayName
```

You can also provide Okta group names that contain spaces:

```
knife data bag from okta group users admins "Linux-Admins,Windows-Admins,Other Admins" -a displayName
```

### Limiting amount of changes

In the case where you want not upload a data bag if there more changes than expected (e.g. if running this plugin via a cron job), you can use the `--max-change` attribute:

```
knife data bag from okta group users linux_admins Linux-Admins -a displayName --max-change 5
```

This attribute watches for additions and removes, so using our example above if there were 3 additions and 2 removals then the data bag would not be uploaded as it met the threshold set (5).
